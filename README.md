# SpitWad Willy
A 90s game recreation

At the end of first semester of sophomore year, my Fundamentals of Computing I class at the University of Notre Dame had a final project assignment to be written in C. I chose to code SpitWad Willy, a classic 90s game my brothers and I had played on MS-DOS growing up. This was my first time implementing a graphical interface and I loved it! I began by designing a new color scheme and map and created a 2D array to represent the pixels of the character. I coded collision detection and designed it from the ground up to work on many screen sizes.

To play SpitWad Willy, the user uses the right and left arrow keys to move the character and presses the spacebar to shoot the ball. To quit, the user can press 'q' or exit the window.

Note: the included gfx graphics library was created by Ramzi Bualuan.
